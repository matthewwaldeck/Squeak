<h2>
  What does it do?
</h2>
Squeak is a small collection of scripts and applications that can be used for a number of tasks, from removing preinstalled "antivirus" programs to collecting hardware info and more.
It contains an ever-evolving collections of tools and applications to keep your system running smoothly and diagnose any issues that may arise.<br>

<h2>
  Who is it for?
</h2>
Squeak is designed to be used by anyone, but it is meant for administrators and IT professionals to assist in their day-to-day work. Something to be added to the "Tools" drive and stowed in your back pocket.
